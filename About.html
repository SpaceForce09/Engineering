                Hello to the About page of this website. My name is Eli Eagleston, I assist with the creation of the Project 2-7 Universe. I sit on the council of Advisors to the Admiral. The Admiral is an anonymous person who oversees the entire creation, work, timeline, and themes of the universe of Project 2-7 similar to how a game master would. except this universe is incredibly in-depth. the Universe has been under construction for at least a decade. the fruits of said universe is now ready to come to this universe to our land. 
                
                Project 2-7 is a universe dedicated to creativity, realism, and support. We want to support each and every individual who wants to support our universe or start their own similar project. supporting our project requires a somewhat thought out and realistic approach. a few less realistic are also acceptable, you can see more about submitting ideas in the "support" tab. we would love to see what you want next!
                
                Project 2-7 is a universe parallel to our own. While it is similar, the events past the year 2044 fall differently. Earth grows into a large nation dedicated to protecting its people. This Nation is referred to as the United Earth Colonies, (UEC). At times Earth may appear less superior in all numbers, people, technology, knowledge, and experience. Its foes in this new universe are superior, Humankind will need to evolve, to find the flaws and weaknesses of their enemies. 
                
                there are a few ships that we follow in this universe, from oldest (closest to 2044) to the newest (most technologically advanced): The SWMS Expanse, SFFS Cronos, SFFS Eagle, SFFS Fenix, SFSAV Starcloak, TPC Gamma. These are the main ships of this universe. Each and every one of them is special, They have their own system, their own traits, their own special ability. They are not listed here, if you want to know them I suggest you find them in the database, which is another link above.
